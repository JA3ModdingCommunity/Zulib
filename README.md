### Zulib Base Library for Jagged Alliance 3 Modding


Zulib is a base library for the Jagged Alliance 3 Modding Community,
developed by the JA3 Modding Scene. It contains useful functions, examples,
notes and more to facilitate and enhance the modding of JA3.

Zulib is a project that aims to make JA3 modding easier, better, and more fun.
It is created by modders for modders, and it welcomes anyone who wants to join the Zulib community.
Anyone can contribute to its development and improvement.
Zulib is not only a tool, but also a content provider. You can use Zulib to create your own mods, but you can also use Zulib as a mod itself.

The idea behind Zulib is to provide a platform and a community for JA3 modders to share their knowledge, experience, and creations with each other. Zulib is not only a collection of functions, examples, notes, and more, but also a way of modding that encourages cooperation, innovation, and quality.

## With Zulib you can:

### Add new content  
such as weapons, armor, skills, missions, characters and more.
#
### Customize existing content
such as game balance, difficulty level, graphics, sound and user interface.
#
### Create your own mods
with the help of documentation, tutorials, templates and code snippets.
#
### Use other mods
that are compatible with Zulib or have Zulib as a dependency.
#
### Become part of the JA3 Modding Community
by sharing your mods, giving feedback, asking questions and interacting with other modders.



#
#### Zulib is a free and open source for all JA3 modders. To learn more about Zulib, visit the Wiki. If you have any questions or issues, you can contact Zulib members on the Jagged Alliance Discord.
